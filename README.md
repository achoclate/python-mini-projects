# Guess the Number Game
This repository contains a simple Python project where users are challenged to guess a randomly generated number within a user-specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

## Features
Input Validation: Ensures that the user inputs a valid number for the range.
Random Number Generation: Generates a random number within the specified range.
Continuous Feedback: Guides the user with hints to adjust their guesses.
Guess Count: Tracks the number of guesses taken to reach the correct answer.
## How It Works
The program prompts the user to input a number to set the upper limit of the guessing range.
If the user inputs a valid number greater than 0, the program generates a random number within that range.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low.
The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
Once the correct number is guessed, the program displays the total number of guesses taken.
