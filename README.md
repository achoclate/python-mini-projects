1. # Guess the Number Game
This repository contains a simple Python project where users are challenged to guess a randomly generated number within a user-specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

## Features
Input Validation: Ensures that the user inputs a valid number for the range.
Random Number Generation: Generates a random number within the specified range.
Continuous Feedback: Guides the user with hints to adjust their guesses.
Guess Count: Tracks the number of guesses taken to reach the correct answer.
## How It Works
The program prompts the user to input a number to set the upper limit of the guessing range.
If the user inputs a valid number greater than 0, the program generates a random number within that range.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low.
The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
Once the correct number is guessed, the program displays the total number of guesses taken.
## Getting Started

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by common beginner exercises in Python programming.

2. # Quiz Game
Welcome to the Quiz Game! This is a simple Python project where users are prompted to answer several questions about geography. The game keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback on each answer.

## How It Works
The program welcomes the user and asks if they want to play.
If the user agrees, the game begins with a series of questions.
The user's answers are checked for correctness, and their score is updated accordingly.
After all questions are answered, the user's total score and percentage of correct answers are displayed.
## Features
User Interaction: The game starts only if the user agrees to play.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of the user's correct answers.
Feedback: Provides immediate feedback on whether the user's answer is correct or incorrect.
Final Score Display: Displays the total number of correct answers and the percentage score at the end of the game.
## Getting Started
